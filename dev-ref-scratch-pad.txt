Android dev tips:
1. When devices are not recognized you start getting platform not supported etc. when you try to run on android (ionic run android). If you try adb devices you will see:

adb devices
List of devices attached
 ????????????   no permissions

to resolve try this

sudo adb kill-server
sudo adb start-server

This worked for me. Sometime this is not enough. You need the device to authorize usage. That worked for my other device.
