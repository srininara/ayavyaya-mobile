When load happens after 200 index, server throws a 400 error. need to handle that. - Handled but keeps scrolling forever and causes more problems - stream of requests - DOS attack.


GET http://192.168.1.44:9080/grihasthi/api/v1.0/expenses?index=250&size=50 400 (BAD REQUEST)

XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://192.168.1.44:9080/grihasthi/api/v1.0/expenses?index=250&size=50. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8100' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 400.

 Planning to use simple local error handler. Later can use an interceptor.

Fixed it a long time back. Don't even know when exactly. Also finished with the refresh code as well
